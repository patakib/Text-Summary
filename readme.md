# Text Summarizer Django App
This is a Django application which is able to perform text summarization in English language.  
The app has been written in Python applying Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) package and the web framework is Django.

The original code for the NLTK function is taken from [here](https://github.com/edubey/text-summarizer/blob/master/text-summarizer.py). I made some modifications and implemented it in Django deployment, but huge credit to [edubey](https://github.com/edubey) who shared his code for text summarization.
