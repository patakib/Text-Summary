Resources, inspiration:
The original code for the NLTK functions is taken from [here](https://github.com/edubey/text-summarizer/blob/master/text-summarizer.py). I made some modifications and implemented it in Django deployment, but huge credit to [edubey](https://github.com/edubey) who shared his code for text summarization.  
I also applied and got inspiration from [Antonio Mel√©](https://github.com/zenx) from his book "Django 3 by Example". Thank you all for sharing valuable content!
